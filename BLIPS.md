By merging Casey Newton's practical implementation with Andy Matuschak’s theoretical research, we can define "blips" as a system for **"programmable attention."**

Here is the merged explanation of what "blips" are, how they work, and the philosophy behind them.

### 1. The Core Concept: "Augmented Attention"

A "blip" is more than just a note; it is a **unit of attention managed by software.**

* **Andy Matuschak’s Theory:** In his research on "augmented attention" (specifically his work on the *Orbit* project), Matuschak proposes that we shouldn't just write notes and hope to find them later. Instead, we should treat fleeting thoughts as "tasks" for our future selves. A "blip" is a small, transient idea that the system is responsible for bringing back to your attention.
* **Casey Newton’s Application:** Casey adapted this by treating a "blip" as a "seed" for a story—a single sentence like *"We are in an AI bubble"*—that he doesn't have time to write yet but doesn't want to lose.

### 2. The Mechanism: "Random Resurfacing"

The defining feature of a "blip" is that it **comes back to find you.**

* **The Problem:** Most people take "fleeting notes" (scratches in a notebook) that act as a "bucket for storage" and are never seen again.
* **The "Blip" Solution:** You use software to schedule these notes to reappear later.
* **Andy’s Method:** Uses spaced-repetition algorithms (similar to flashcards but for creativity) to "incrementally develop inklings." The software decides when you need to see the note again to keep the idea alive in your mind.
* **Casey’s Method:** He built a simple version in the app **Capacities**. He creates a "blip" object and set up a query to **randomly display five old blips** every morning in his daily journal.



### 3. The Lifecycle of a Blip

The goal is to move an idea from a "fleeting thought" to a "permanent contribution" (or what Matuschak calls an *Evergreen Note*).

* **Stage 1: Capture (The Blip):** You capture a raw, unpolished thought instantly.
* **Stage 2: Resurfacing (The Review):** The system shows you the blip days or weeks later.
* *Action:* You might add a new link, refine the sentence, or realize it connects to another blip.
* *Matuschak’s Philosophy:* This uses "spaced repetition" not for memorization, but for **synthesis**. You are looking for patterns over time.


* **Stage 3: Graduation (The Article):** Eventually, a blip accumulates enough "mass" (links, evidence, refined thoughts) that it naturally evolves into a full newsletter column or essay.

### Summary

In short, a **Blip** is a **fleeting note that is systematically resurfaced**. It merges Andy Matuschak’s "tools for thought" research (using algorithms to aid creativity) with Casey Newton’s need for a practical editorial workflow (tracking news trends over time).
